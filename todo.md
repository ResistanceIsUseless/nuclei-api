  - Added status tracking (queued, running, completed, failed)
  - Added timestamps for request lifecycle

- [x] ⚡ Async Processing: Queue scans for background execution
  - Implemented queue system with 10 concurrent scan limit
  - Added background processing of scans
  - Added queue management endpoints

- [x] 📊 Progress Tracking: Real-time scan progress and statistics
  - [x] Add progress percentage tracking
  - [x] Add scan statistics (templates run, vulnerabilities found)
  - [x] Add real-time progress updates via WebSocket

- [x] 🔄 TUI Dashboard: View server status and scan progress
  - [x] Design TUI layout
  - [x] Implement server status dashboard
  - [x] Add real-time scan progress visualization
  - [x] Add queue management interface

### Planned Features
